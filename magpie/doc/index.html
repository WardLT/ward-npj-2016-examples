	<h2>What is Magpie?</h2>
	<p>Magpie is an extensible platform for using machine learning to create models of the properties of material.</p>
	
	<p>Magpie is also an acronym for &ldquo;Material-Agnostic Platform for Informatics and Exploration&rdquo;, and is named after an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoaEBb4IN4Q">intelligent bird</a>.
	
	<h2>Reasons to use Magpie</h2>
	
	<ol>
	<li>Ability to manipulate datasets, create models, and evaluate performance in the same program
	<li>Access to extensive library of machine learning algorithms through <a href="http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/">Weka</a>
	<li>Interactive text-based scripting interface
	<li>Easy sharing of models in a machine-independent format
	</ol>
	
	<h2>Getting Magpie</h2>

	<p>Magpie open source, and is both hosted on <a href="https://bitbucket.org/wolverton/magpie/">BitBucket</a> and available in compiled form on <a href="http://oqmd.org/static/analytics/magpie/Magpie.zip">OQMD.org</a>. The distribution of Magpie includes:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>All libraries necessary to run Magpie</li>
	<li>This manual, and documentation for the Java interface</li>
	<li>Example scripts for several common tasks</li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Magpie is written entirely in Java, which allows it to be run on most computers without modification. As long as the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jre7-downloads-1880261.html">Java&nbsp;7 Runtime Environment</a> is installed on your computer, Magpie should run without issue.</p>

	<h2>Learning About Magpie</h2>

	<p>If you are brand new to Magpie, you might want to read the tutorial section of this manual and then review a few example scripts:
	
	<ul>
		<li><h3><a href="tutorial.html">Tutorial</a></h3></li>
		<li><h3><a href="text-interface.html">Text Interface</a></h3></li>
		<li><h3><a href="../examples/index.html">Example Scripts</a></h3></li>
		<li><h3><a href="variables.html">Variable Types</a></h3></li>
		<li><h3><a href="java-interface.html">Introduction to Java Interface</a></h3></li>
		<li><h3><a href="../javadoc/index.html">Java API Documentation</a></h3></li>
		<li><h3><a href="contributing.html">How to Contribute</a></h3></li>
	</ul>
	
	<p>Additionally, you may also want to read the following article, which provides a short introduction to using machine learning to predict new materials and explains the science behind one of algorithms available through Magpie.</p>
